          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Cameron and I am 27 years old, I am an avid learner of web development, design as well as software engineering. I am really passionate about building intuitive web applications
            and designing responsive websites that make use of best practices and modern design implementations. I have been working in development and design for a little over 3 years now and have built
            a few simple applications and websites. I am eager to learn and grow as a developer and a designer and to keep shattering the high skill ceiling that is web development, design and software engineering.

            <h4>Hyperion, Software Engineering Bootcamp</h4>
            <p>The Hyperion Software Engineering bootcamp was my introduction into software engineering and advanced concepts within python, a basic foray into data analyzing and engineering
              as well as the use of Django frameworks and how they can be used to integrate web applications with the use of python and its various modules. The great thing about the course is that
              it really stretches your growth over a short period of time, but requires a good chunk of commitment, but if you are passionate about this field and want to stay ahead of the curve in terms
              of the advancedment of technology especially with the prospect of quality AI at the doorstep. It was a great decision. I took the course part-time as I work full time. The reason I took
              this course was that the company I work for is trying to move all its development in-house. And understanding these basic concepts is merely the stepping stone for development opportunities.

              <li>Date: - Date: </li> <!--Don't know the exact dates, my employer will let me know-->
              <li>I have worked for the company Taggit from 2019 where I have worked through various roles during my employment. I started off in sales where I would keep up to date with best
                practices, products and tools within the field which is asset management and RFID. My role was to take calls and respond to emails, man the chatdesk to answer any queries and close clients
                I then started focusing on the web development aspect because an opportunity presented itself that the company needed a site rebuild as the previous handler of the website handed this over to me
                so I took on this responsibility and learned the basics of web design and development as well as SEO optimization. I also do assist with installations of physical products and services for clients
                when they are pursuing a system we provide. This would explain why my title is Technical Support and IT.
